# dungeon
A procedural dungeon generator for the web. 

The construction of the maze is based on Prim's algorithm [as explained](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm) by Jamis Buck.

## Current Sample Maze

## TO DO

- [X] Shave off useless corridors
- [X] Connect corridors with rooms
- [ ] Revamp graphics
- [ ] Procedural room contents
- [ ] Simple dungeon stories?

## What's in store
- First should be completing the dang maze. It will be very similar to the way it is done by Bob Nystrom in [his post](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/).
- After that comes the population of those rooms with stuff. By stuff I mean treasures and monsters. Also, put traps in the corridors. I might decide to align these monsters, treasures and traps to a specific ruleset or I might choose to make it more general and make it work like suggestions to give more flexibility to GMs.

## Update schedule

Hopefully weekly? This is sort of a whenever-free-time-allows kinda deal so it's up the Old Ones to determine that. 

## How can I contribute?

However you wish. Documentation is always welcome, as well as constructive criticism. I'm new to this whole Git thing so I guess I'll be evaluating anything else on a case-by-case basis.

### A caveat
English isn't my first language; Spanish is. I'll try to keep the docs and comments in English but I make no promises regarding the commit messages. Those messages I write them as spur of the moment stuff while trying to be descriptive. So, yeah.
